## 👋 Hi there
I am passionate about all things autonomy, robotics, and software engineering. 
I am currently pursuing a PhD in motion planning for autonomous vehicles at the Technical University of Munich.
Below, you can find more about myself and projects I have worked on.


## 💻 Projects
I have initiated and contributed to various open-source projects related to autonomous driving, motion planning and vehicle dynamics.
Many of those are part of the [CommonRoad](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/) platform and have resulted from my research work.
Here are a few selected highlights:

- [CommonRoad-Reach](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-reachable-set): Software to compute the reachable set of an AV in dynamic scenarios, and generate collision-free driving corridors which are used as safety constraints for planning.
- [CommonRoad Reactive Planner](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-reactive-planner): A sampling-based motion planner for autonomous vehicles using quintic polynomials in the Frenet frame.
- [ComonRoad-CLCS](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-clcs): Software to construct curvilinear coordinate systems (aka Frenet frames), and perform efficient coordinate transformations.
- [CommonRoad-Autoware Interface (CR2AW)](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-autoware-interface): An interface for deploying CommonRoad motion planners in the Autoware software stack for rapid sim-to-real transfer of planners. Winning project of the Autoware challenge 2024.
- [CommonRoad Vehicle Models](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-vehicle-models): Collection of vehicle models of different simulation fidelities commonly used in motion planning and control.
- [No more traffic tickets](https://github.com/CommonRoad/no-more-traffic-tickets): Software for a [framework](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11030935) for guaranteeing rule-compliance and safety for AV motion planning.
- [Frenetix](https://github.com/TUM-AVS/Frenetix-Motion-Planner): An efficient and parallelized version of the sampling-based planner using quintic polynomials.
- [CommonRoad Drivability Checker](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-drivability-checker): A toolbox containing useful methods for efficient collision detection and road compliance checking for motion planning.
